# Ultimate Modding Guide Marvel rivals

## prepare rivals for mod installation (skippable if you already have some mods installed)

1. download [fmodel ](https://fmodel.app/) 
2. open fmodel and set path to Marvel Rivals ROOT Install directory (ex: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\MarvelRivals)
3. Change UE Version to "GAME_MarvelRivals"

### then we need to add AES key and mapping file

in fmodel :  
File > AES

add: 0x0C263D8C22DCB085894899C3A3796383E9BF9DE0CBFB08C9BF2DEF2E84F29D74

settings > Local Mapping file (check it)
and add from from fmodel-files from this repository  (5.3.2-1525091+++depot_marvel+S1_1_release-Marvel.usmap)

### now export all files from .paks

1. in fmodel open pakchunkCharacter-Windows.pak
2. (new windows will oopen) and then right-click on Marvel > Save Folder's Package models
3. navigate to where you opened FModel from, right next to it should be Output Folder, open it
4. navigate to Outpout > Exports
